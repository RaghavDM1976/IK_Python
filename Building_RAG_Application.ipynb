        "\n",
        "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced method to enhance **LLMs** with external knowledge. Instead of relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, RAG allows the LLM to retrieve relevant information from external databases (like vector stores) during inference, making it suitable for dynamic and domain-specific applications.\n",

        "- **Domain Knowledge Gaps**: LLMs can be limited in specific knowledge areas, especially in evolving fields.\n",

        "- **Handling Knowledge Gaps**: Allows LLMs to access external databases, which are often required for specialized tasks.\n",
        "- **Reducing Hallucinations**: RAG reduces the risk of LLMs making up answers or providing misleading responses.\n",

It depends on the symptoms and their persistence. However, it's better to consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation, especially if symptoms persist or worsen, rather than self-diagnosing.\", 'Are chronic conditions different from acute conditions? Yes, chronic conditions are long-term health problems requiring ongoing management, while acute conditions develop suddenly and may resolve with appropriate treatment. The approach to treatment and management differs significantly between the two.', 'Can I get medical consultation from another state? Yes, you can receive medical consultation from healthcare providers in another state through telemedicine services. However, some states have specific licensing requirements for out-of-state medical practice.', \"Is medical consultation mandatory for prescription medications? Yes, prescription medications require a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Over-the-counter medications don't require prescriptions, but consultation is recommended for chronic use.\", 'Can people with multiple conditions see different specialists? Yes, patients with multiple medical conditions often need care from various specialists. Care coordination between providers is important to avoid medication interactions and ensure comprehensive treatment.', 'Can I use medical consultation for second opinions? Yes, seeking second opinions is a patient right and often recommended for serious diagnoses or major treatment decisions. Most insurance plans cover second opinion consultations.', 'What is the difference between primary care and specialist care? The basic difference between primary care and specialist care is that primary care providers offer comprehensive, general medical care and serve as the first point of contact, while specialists focus on specific medical conditions or body systems.', 'Can I get medical consultation for preventive care? Yes, preventive care consultations are essential for maintaining health and early detection of potential problems. Regular check-ups and screenings are recommended based on age and risk factors.', 'Can I discuss mental health concerns during medical consultation? You can discuss mental health concerns with your primary care provider, though they may refer you to mental health specialists for specialized care. Mental health is an integral part of overall health care.', \"Can medical records be transferred to a new doctor? Yes, medical records can be transferred to new healthcare providers. You may need to sign authorization forms and may provide the new provider's information for direct transfer.\", 'What information is required for updating family medical history? To update family medical history, you should provide information about genetic conditions, chronic diseases, and causes of death in immediate family members (parents, siblings, children).', 'Can lifestyle factors be considered during medical consultation? Yes, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption are important considerations during medical consultation as they significantly impact health outcomes and treatment planning.', 'How can I prepare for a medical consultation? Prepare by listing current symptoms, medications, questions for the doctor, and bringing relevant medical records. Arrive early and bring insurance information and identification.', 'Can I coordinate care between multiple doctors? Yes, care coordination between multiple healthcare providers is important for comprehensive treatment. Your primary care physician often serves as the coordinator, and you can request communication between specialists.', 'Can patients request specific tests during consultation? Patients can discuss and request specific tests, though the healthcare provider will determine medical necessity based on symptoms, examination, and clinical judgment.', 'Is it possible to get same-day medical consultation? Many healthcare facilities offer same-day appointments for urgent but non-emergency conditions. Availability depends on the facility and the urgency of your medical needs.', 'What consultation options are available for medical conditions? Medical consultations can be conducted in-person, through telemedicine, or via phone consultations, depending on the condition and healthcare provider capabilities.', 'Can patients living abroad access their medical records? Yes, patients can typically access their medical records from abroad through secure patient portals or by requesting copies through proper authorization procedures.', 'How can patients submit questions between appointments? Many healthcare providers offer patient portals, secure messaging systems, or nurse consultation lines for questions between appointments.', 'Can patients use mobile apps for medical consultation? Yes, many healthcare systems offer mobile apps for appointment scheduling, secure messaging with providers, accessing test results, and even virtual consultations.', 'Is it necessary to download healthcare apps for medical services? While not always necessary, healthcare apps often provide convenient features for appointment management, prescription refills, and communication with healthcare providers.', 'Can patients seek medical consultation without insurance? Yes, uninsured patients can seek medical consultation by paying out-of-pocket, using community health centers, or exploring assistance programs offered by healthcare facilities.', 'Can patients request medical consultation for family members? Adult patients must provide their own consent for medical consultation. For minors, parents or legal guardians can request consultation and make medical decisions.', 'Can patients receive medical consultation at temporary locations? Yes, urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, and telemedicine services provide medical consultation options when patients are away from their regular healthcare providers.']\n"

Yes, chronic conditions are long-term health problems requiring ongoing management, while acute conditions develop suddenly and may resolve with appropriate treatment.

            "Types of Medical Conditions In healthcare, several types of medical conditions exist: Acute conditions and Chronic conditions. 1. Acute Medical Conditions: Acute conditions develop suddenly and require immediate medical attention. They include conditions like heart attacks, strokes, infections, and injuries that need prompt treatment to prevent complications. 2. Chronic Medical Conditions: Chronic conditions are long-term health problems that persist over time and require ongoing management. They include diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, and other conditions that need continuous care and monitoring. Both acute and chronic conditions require proper medical evaluation and treatment. The approach depends on the severity, symptoms, and individual patient factors.\n",
            "What are Medical Conditions? Medical conditions are health problems or diseases that affect the normal functioning of the human body. They can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) and may require medical attention, ongoing treatment, or lifestyle modifications. Understanding medical conditions is essential for proper healthcare management and early intervention.\n",
            "Importance of Medical Consultation for different health conditions Health Conditions comprise of Emergency conditions, Chronic conditions, and Preventive care. A basic overview to understand the importance of Medical Consultation with respect to these three categories can be understood as: Emergency Conditions: For sudden onset medical emergencies where immediate treatment is required. Emergency conditions like heart attacks and strokes require urgent medical intervention for best outcomes. Chronic Conditions: For ongoing health problems that require regular monitoring and management. Conditions such as diabetes and hypertension where patients need continuous care and medication adjustments. Preventive Care: For routine health maintenance and early detection. Regular check-ups and screenings help identify potential health issues before they become serious problems.\n"
